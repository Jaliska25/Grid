Hi! 👋  
This repository contains another layout-focused exercise from the Cybersecurity Master's program.

## 🎯 Challenge Constraints

- ✅ Only **CSS Grid** was allowed for layout.
- ❌ No Flexbox or absolute positioning.
- ✅ The page had to be **responsive**.
- ✅ Clean and semantic HTML5 structure.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – For semantic structure  
- **CSS3 (Grid)** – For layout and responsive styling  

## 📁 Project Structure

├── index.html → Main HTML layout

└── style.css → Grid-based styling

🧠 This exercise was a great deep dive into CSS Grid, and it really helped me understand how powerful and precise it can be for building complex layouts. **Honestly, I found Grid much easier to work with than Flexbox** — it gave me more control over placement and alignment, especially for this kind of structured page.


Thanks for stopping by!🥰
